3.PAST USAGE:
     1.Machine learning 1 project:Submitted by Anagha Ashok
       Goal is to classify the species that appear in camera trap images.

4.RELEVANT INFORMATION:
     -- One of the best tools we have to study wildlife populations is camera traps. 
        camera traps are one of the best tools available to study and monitor wildlife populations, 
        and the enormous amounts of data they provide can be used to track different species for conservation effortsâ€”
        once they are processed.In the dataset there are seven types of critters captured in this set of images: 
        birds, civets, duikers, hogs, leopards, other monkeys, and rodents. There are also images that contain no animals.

5.NUMBER OF ATTRIBUTES:8

6.ATTRIBUTE INFORMATION:
      1.id (string, unique identifier) - a unique identifier for each image
